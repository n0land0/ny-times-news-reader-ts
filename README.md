# NY Times News Reader

The deployed app can be viewed [here](https://ny-times-news-reader.surge.sh/).

## Abstract

This app was built as part of a [timed (8 hrs) practice take-home challenge](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe) issued by [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.edu/), using the [NYT Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview). 

Users are greeted with a gallery of articles and are able to navigate to that article's page on the New York Times website if interested. Users can also filter the gallery by section, corresponding to the different sections of the NYT.

## Technologies

### Front End

![React (Context API, Hooks)](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![SCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-CC6699?style=for-the-badge&logo=sass&logoColor=white)

## Wins

- Although it wasn't required, my self-directed goal for this challenge was to see how quickly I could throw together a front-end codebase with TypeScript, and gladly I found that the workflow of updating state, interfaces, props, etc. as needed was fairly effortless.

## Challenges

- Sophisticated UI beyond basic usability was not a focus of this challenge, but in hindsight I wish I had taken the opportunity to try out a new UI component library, since the app is so simple.
